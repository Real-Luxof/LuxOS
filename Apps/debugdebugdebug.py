    Summary: Need I say more?

    Args:
        seed (str): The seed for the world. Leave as None for the engine to pick one for you.
        width (int): The width of the world.
        height (int): The height of the world.
        depth (int): Ì¶gÌ¶Ì¶oÌ¶Ì¶dÌ¶ Ì¶iÌ¶Ì¶'Ì¶Ì¶mÌ¶ Ì¶hÌ¶Ì¶aÌ¶Ì¶rÌ¶Ì¶dÌ¶ Ì¶aÌ¶Ì¶lÌ¶Ì¶rÌ¶Ì¶eÌ¶Ì¶aÌ¶Ì¶dÌ¶Ì¶yÌ¶ DEPTH!!! what is there to be confused about?
        
        air (block): The thing that permeates open spaces.
        stone (block): The thing that permeates closed spaces.
        
        limit (Limit): Prevents world generation indexes above upper_limit and below lower_limit.

        biomes (list[Biome]): Biomes. Just look at the default to figure out its structure.

        ore_config (list[OreConfiguration]): Look at the default. spawn_limit limits how many of that ore can spawn at a single Y coordinate.
        
        next_block_limits (Limit): Look at the default. This controls how far up or down a block can be from another block.
        
        terrain_types (list): What terrain types do you want to be able to be generated? Defaults to the default ones from the Engine.

    Returns:
        list: A 2D Array. This is your 2D world.
