# LuxOS
Just a project I made for fun.

Currently it can't do many things, the most interesting parts of it are the Apps you can download from one very specific website.
It cannot edit files or stuff like that, though I do plan to add those.
The Music command is incomplete, it will not work.

Probably never gonna compile all libraries to .exe files so anyone with a Windows machine can run it.
