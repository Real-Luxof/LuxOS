# LuxOS
Just a project I made for fun.

Currently it can't do many things, the most interesting part of it is Integri. Downloading doesn't work either.
The Music command is incomplete, it will not work.

Probably never gonna compile all libraries to .exe files so anyone with a Windows machine can run it.
